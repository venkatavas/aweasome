# AI Usage

This project was built with assistance from AI tools:

- ChatGPT/Cursor for scaffolding components (`Upload`, `PromptStyle`, `Preview`, `History`), the `useGeneration` hook (retry + abort + history), and Tailwind tweaks.
- AI suggested fixing Tailwind v4 PostCSS by switching to `@tailwindcss/postcss`.
- Test cases were outlined by AI and refined manually.

Human review ensured TypeScript strictness, accessibility labels, and safe fallbacks.
